## Clone the repository: 
``` git clone https://github.com/AmmarSahyoun/Dungeon-Game.git ``` 

## Introduction
This library system allows users to search for books, check availability, and rent books. It utilizes object serialization to persist book and user data.

## Features
* Add, remove, and update book records
* Register and manage users
* Search for books by title, author, or category
* Check book availability and rent books
* Store book and user data in external files using object serialization

## How to Use
1. Run the main Program class.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the system.
3. Data is stored in `books.dat` and `users.dat` files.

## Technology Stack
* Java 11
* Built-in object serialization

## OOP Concepts Demonstrated
* **Classes:** Book, User, Library
* **Encapsulation:** Data hiding within classes (e.g., book title, author, ISBN)
* **Inheritance:** (If applicable, e.g., different book types)
* **Polymorphism:** (If applicable, e.g., different user types)
